  <h3>Breaking Barriers for Dyslexic Readers</h3>
  <p><em>Transforming photos into accessible, engaging storybooks</em></p>

## 🌟 The Problem

**1 in 10 people worldwide are dyslexic** — nearly 1 billion people affected by a condition that traditional reading tools simply don't address.

The consequences are profound:
- **Low confidence** in reading abilities
- **Poor engagement** with traditional text
- **Lifelong learning gaps** that compound over time

The current educational system is built for readers — not for the diverse ways people think and process information.
